I am [Pawel Uramowski](http://uramowski.pl), professional Software Quality Engineer with 4 years of experience in various IT projects (startups, large companies - mobile or web businesses).
I am an automation passionate, trying to write code whenever it's possible. Since I've joined [Hailo](http://hailocab.com) I am in love with Ruby, Calabash and Cucumber.
Sometimes I manage to get some time and write posts about quality related matters (I hope I did). Glad if you found it interesting!
