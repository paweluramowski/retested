title: 5 attributes of a good tester

Recently I had an interesting discussion with friend of mine. We've been talking about our jobs, what makes testers good in what they're doing.
We came to conclusion that testers are kind of detectives and managers at once. Why? You probably know that very well...

First of all, that's what we do - we look for possible problems, we know they are there, all we need is to dig in and search.
You can prove that bugs are present in system under test, however you can't ever say for sure that there are definitely no bugs in feature you test. Can you?

Second part of our job is to manage situation you see all around. You found an issue, that's great! But what's next? Issue management is becoming even more important these days,
as working in agile environment makes you responsible for whole quality process. You can read a lot about that, in a nutshell - your role starts long before development itself starts,
and it does not end when you report a bug or idea. Your role is to keep your hand on pulse, make sure issue is properly prioritised, fixed soon and it does not reappear after some time
(if you want to be involved in whole software lifecycle it's worth to invest in regression testing - test automation is the best tool you can have).

I'm not inventing a wheel right now, just my thoughts about attributes which increase probability that person will be a good tester:

1. Skepticism
2. Persistence
3. Curiosity
4. Cleverness
5. Proactiveness

Don't think there is a need to explain any of them, although you may see it totally different!
